Daily Routine Tracker
========================================

Working app [here](https://chrisregner.github.io/daily-routines-tracker)

A small app that...

1. lets you manage (add, edit, delete, sort) a list of routines (so, another to do app?);
2. lets you specify how much time you want to work on each routine;
3. lets you track the time for that routine; and...
4. notifies you when you've tracked the specified amount of time for a routine.

You can also import/export data (routines), and the data will persist as long as you don’t clear the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
